# AlphaForce - Hackathon Submission Speech

**Good morning everyone.**
We’re here to introduce **AlphaForce**. The AI co-pilot for financial advising. It helps advisors stay on top of clients, portfolios, and decisions — without the daily chaos.

### **The Problem**

Here’s the truth. Financial advisors aren’t short on data — they’re buried under it.

CRMs like Salesforce record everything, sure. But they don’t tell you *what to do next*. Advisors waste hours digging through records, trying to connect dots that should already be connected.

Follow-ups get missed. Hot prospects go cold. Emails and Phone calls get generic. Not because advisors don’t care — but because no system out there is taking care of all this

And dashboards? Tons of charts, zero guidance. A portfolio drops 5%, and you’re left guessing — call the client, wait it out, or panic quietly?

As client lists grow, keeping track of everyone becomes impossible. Someone always slips through. And when that happens, trust takes the hit.

**That’s the mess. AlphaForce steps in to clean it up.**

## [THE SOLUTION - 4 Lines]

AlphaForce solves this by being the **intelligent layer on top of Salesforce data**. It automatically monitors all your client relationships, identifies which clients need attention and _why_, surfaces high-probability opportunities, and provides AI-powered recommendations at every decision point. We're not replacing Salesforce – we're making Salesforce actually work for you and tableau talk to you. AlphaForce turns passive data into active intelligence, giving advisors back time to do what they do best: building relationships and closing deals.

## [LANDING PAGE WALKTHROUGH]

Let me show you the landing page. Here is the main headline

Right below, there's a subtitle that reads: **"Experience AlphaForce by stepping into the shoes of Saul Goodman, a financial advisor"** – because we've personalized this entire demo around a character so you can really feel the advisor experience.

Now, here's the bright cyan **"Experience AlphaForce"** button here that triggers the experience. 

Below the buttons, you'll see a gentle **"Scroll to explore"** indicator with an animated chevron – this lets you know there's more content below.

The page continues to showcase the core problems advisors face:

- **Follow-ups slip**
- **Opportunities decay** 
- **Context is missing** 
- **Scaling breaks** 

Further down, there are feature highlight sections

At the bottom of the landing page, there's a **final CTA section** that says **"Ready to lead?"** with another prominent **"Experience AlphaForce"** button – this is for anyone scrolling who didn't click the first one.
